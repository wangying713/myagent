# Tracing

The Agents SDK includes built-in tracing, collecting a comprehensive record of events during an agent run: LLM generations, tool calls, handoffs, guardrails, and even custom events that occur. Using the [Traces dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/traces), you can debug, visualize, and monitor your workflows during development and in production.

!!!note

    Tracing is enabled by default. You can disable it in three common ways:

    1. You can globally disable tracing by setting the env var `OPENAI_AGENTS_DISABLE_TRACING=1`
    2. You can globally disable tracing in code with [`set_tracing_disabled(True)`][agents.set_tracing_disabled]
    3. You can disable tracing for a single run by setting [`agents.run.RunConfig.tracing_disabled`][] to `True`

***Tracing is unavailable for organizations that use OpenAI's APIs under a Zero Data Retention (ZDR) policy.***

## Traces and spans

-   **Traces** represent a single end-to-end operation of a "workflow". They're composed of Spans. Traces have the following properties:
    -   `workflow_name`: This is the name of the logical workflow or app. For example "Code generation" or "Customer service".
    -   `trace_id`: A unique ID for the trace. Automatically generated if you don't pass one. Must have the format `trace_<32_alphanumeric>`.
    -   `group_id`: Optional group ID, to link multiple traces from the same conversation. For example, you might use a chat thread ID.
    -   `disabled`: If True, the trace will not be recorded.
    -   `metadata`: Optional metadata for the trace.
-   **Spans** represent operations that have a start and end time. Spans have:
    -   `started_at` and `ended_at` timestamps.
    -   `trace_id`, to represent the trace they belong to
    -   `parent_id`, which points to the parent Span of this Span (if any)
    -   `span_data`, which is information about the Span. For example, `AgentSpanData` contains information about the Agent, `GenerationSpanData` contains information about the LLM generation, etc.

## Default tracing

By default, the SDK traces the following:

-   The entire `Runner.{run, run_sync, run_streamed}()` is wrapped in a `trace()`.
-   Each runner invocation is wrapped in a `task_span()`.
-   Each model turn is wrapped in a `turn_span()`.
-   Each time an agent runs, it is wrapped in `agent_span()`
-   LLM generations are wrapped in `generation_span()`
-   Function tool calls are each wrapped in `function_span()`
-   Guardrails are wrapped in `guardrail_span()`
-   Handoffs are wrapped in `handoff_span()`
-   Audio inputs (speech-to-text) are wrapped in a `transcription_span()`
-   Audio outputs (text-to-speech) are wrapped in a `speech_span()`
-   The SDK may parent related audio spans under a `speech_group_span()`

By default, the trace name is the literal string `Agent workflow`. You can set this name if you use `trace`, or you can configure the name and other properties with the [`RunConfig`][agents.run.RunConfig].

If you want a more compact hierarchy, disable the automatic task and turn spans for a run. Agent, generation, function, guardrail, handoff, and custom spans are still recorded.

```python
from agents import RunConfig, Runner

result = await Runner.run(
    agent,
    "Hello",
    run_config=RunConfig(tracing={"include_task_and_turn_spans": False}),
)
```

In addition, you can set up [custom trace processors](#custom-tracing-processors) to push traces to other destinations (as a replacement, or secondary destination).

## Long-running workers and immediate exports

The default [`BatchTraceProcessor`][agents.tracing.processors.BatchTraceProcessor] exports traces in the background every few seconds, or sooner when the in-memory queue reaches its size trigger, and also performs a final flush when the process exits. In long-running workers such as Celery, RQ, Dramatiq, or FastAPI background tasks, this means traces are usually exported automatically without any extra code, but they may not appear in the Traces dashboard immediately after each job finishes.

If you need an immediate delivery guarantee at the end of a unit of work, call [`flush_traces()`][agents.tracing.flush_traces] after the trace context exits.

```python
from agents import Runner, flush_traces, trace


@celery_app.task
def run_agent_task(prompt: str):
    try:
        with trace("celery_task"):
            result = Runner.run_sync(agent, prompt)
        return result.final_output
    finally:
        flush_traces()
```

```python
from fastapi import BackgroundTasks, FastAPI
from agents import Runner, flush_traces, trace

app = FastAPI()


def process_in_background(prompt: str) -> None:
    try:
        with trace("background_job"):
            Runner.run_sync(agent, prompt)
    finally:
        flush_traces()


@app.post("/run")
async def run(prompt: str, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
    background_tasks.add_task(process_in_background, prompt)
    return {"status": "queued"}
```

[`flush_traces()`][agents.tracing.flush_traces] blocks until currently buffered traces and spans are exported, so call it after `trace()` closes to avoid flushing a partially built trace. You can skip this call when the default export latency is acceptable.

Disabling tracing prevents the default provider from creating new traces and spans, but it does not discard data that its processors already buffered. [`flush_traces()`][agents.tracing.flush_traces] continues to flush that buffered data after tracing has been disabled through `set_tracing_disabled(True)` or `OPENAI_AGENTS_DISABLE_TRACING=1`.

## Higher level traces

Sometimes, you might want multiple calls to `run()` to be part of a single trace. You can do this by wrapping the entire code in a `trace()`.

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, trace

async def main():
    agent = Agent(name="Joke generator", instructions="Tell funny jokes.")

    with trace("Joke workflow"): # (1)!
        first_result = await Runner.run(agent, "Tell me a joke")
        second_result = await Runner.run(agent, f"Rate this joke: {first_result.final_output}")
        print(f"Joke: {first_result.final_output}")
        print(f"Rating: {second_result.final_output}")
```

1. Because the two calls to `Runner.run` are wrapped in a `with trace()`, both runs become part of one overall trace instead of each creating a separate trace.

## Creating traces

You can use the [`trace()`][agents.tracing.trace] function to create a trace. Traces need to be started and finished. You have two options to do so:

1. **Recommended**: use the trace as a context manager, i.e. `with trace(...) as my_trace`. This will automatically start and end the trace at the right time.
2. You can also manually call [`trace.start()`][agents.tracing.Trace.start] and [`trace.finish()`][agents.tracing.Trace.finish].

The current trace is tracked via a Python [`contextvar`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextvars.html). This means that it works with concurrency automatically. If you manually start and finish a trace, pass `mark_as_current` to `start()` and `reset_current` to `finish()` to update the current trace.

## Creating spans

You can use the various [`*_span()`][agents.tracing.create] methods to create a span. In general, you don't need to manually create spans. A [`custom_span()`][agents.tracing.custom_span] function is available for tracking custom span information.

Spans are automatically part of the current trace, and are nested under the nearest current span, which is tracked via a Python [`contextvar`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextvars.html).

## Sensitive data

Certain spans may capture potentially sensitive data.

The `generation_span()` stores the inputs/outputs of the LLM generation, and `function_span()` stores the inputs/outputs of function calls. These may contain sensitive data, so you can disable capturing that data via [`RunConfig.trace_include_sensitive_data`][agents.run.RunConfig.trace_include_sensitive_data].

For an approval-gated function tool, a span that pauses for approval does not store the SDK's internal result wrapper as tool output. If the application rejects the call with a custom rejection message, the function span stores that message as output and error text only when `trace_include_sensitive_data` is `True`. When the setting is `False`, the span omits the output and uses the generic error text `Tool execution rejected`.

Similarly, Audio spans include base64-encoded PCM data for input and output audio by default. You can disable capturing this audio data by configuring [`VoicePipelineConfig.trace_include_sensitive_audio_data`][agents.voice.pipeline_config.VoicePipelineConfig.trace_include_sensitive_audio_data].

By default, `trace_include_sensitive_data` is `True`. You can set the default without code by exporting the `OPENAI_AGENTS_TRACE_INCLUDE_SENSITIVE_DATA` environment variable to `true/1` or `false/0` before running your app.

When `trace_include_sensitive_data` is `False`, Responses model spans omit the request input and response output. For calls to an official OpenAI endpoint, the spans still include the Responses API `response_id` as correlation metadata. The SDK omits that identifier from redacted spans for custom endpoints.

## Custom tracing processors

The high level architecture for tracing is:

-   At initialization, we create a global [`TraceProvider`][agents.tracing.provider.TraceProvider], which is responsible for creating traces.
-   We configure the `TraceProvider` with a [`BatchTraceProcessor`][agents.tracing.processors.BatchTraceProcessor] that sends traces/spans in batches to a [`BackendSpanExporter`][agents.tracing.processors.BackendSpanExporter], which exports the spans and traces to the OpenAI backend in batches.

To customize this default setup, to send traces to alternative or additional backends or modifying exporter behavior, you have two options:

1. [`add_trace_processor()`][agents.tracing.add_trace_processor] lets you add an **additional** trace processor that will receive traces and spans as they are ready. This lets you do your own processing in addition to sending traces to OpenAI's backend.
2. [`set_trace_processors()`][agents.tracing.set_trace_processors] lets you **replace** the default processors with your own trace processors. This means traces will not be sent to the OpenAI backend unless you include a `TracingProcessor` that does so.

### Redaction before export

Trace processors are independent observers. The default provider catches a processor's callback exceptions and continues calling the other registered processors. A redaction processor registered before an exporter therefore does not prevent that exporter from receiving data if redaction fails. Adding a processor with `add_trace_processor()` also leaves the default OpenAI exporter registered.

When export depends on successful redaction, keep redaction and delivery inside the same application-owned exporter. Use `set_trace_processors()` to replace the default processors with a `BatchTraceProcessor` configured with that exporter. The exporter should copy the serialized payloads, redact the copies, and pass only the redacted results to the destination. If serialization, copying, or redaction fails, discard the batch before invoking the destination. Log a fixed failure message without the payload, exception text, or traceback.

The [trace redaction example](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/blob/main/examples/basic/trace_redaction.py) demonstrates this composition using existing tracing APIs. The example prints only event categories and trace/span linkage IDs to the local console; it makes no API calls. Its allowlist omits names, metadata, errors, and span data. Caller-supplied IDs must contain no sensitive information, or the application must map those IDs to safe values. This diagnostic output is not the OpenAI tracing ingest schema; an application sending data to a backend must supply a redaction policy and destination compatible with that backend.

The redactor and destination are trusted application code. They must not independently log or send the original data. The batch processor can invoke the exporter during background export, explicit flush, or shutdown, so callbacks must be safe to use from those execution contexts. A failed batch is dropped; subsequent batches can still be exported. Replacement affects future processor callbacks and does not erase data already buffered by a previously registered processor. Configure the replacement before creating traces or running agents.


## Tracing with non-OpenAI models

When using non-OpenAI models, you can provide an OpenAI API key to the tracing exporter to enable free tracing in the OpenAI Traces dashboard without disabling tracing. See the [Third-party adapters](models/index.md#third-party-adapters) section in the Models guide for adapter selection and setup caveats.

```python
import os
from agents import set_tracing_export_api_key, Agent
from agents.extensions.models.any_llm_model import AnyLLMModel

tracing_api_key = os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]
set_tracing_export_api_key(tracing_api_key)

model = AnyLLMModel(
    model="your-provider/your-model-name",
    api_key="your-api-key",
)

agent = Agent(
    name="Assistant",
    model=model,
)
```

If you only need a different tracing key for a single run, pass it via `RunConfig` instead of changing the global exporter.

```python
from agents import Runner, RunConfig

await Runner.run(
    agent,
    input="Hello",
    run_config=RunConfig(tracing={"api_key": "sk-tracing-123"}),
)
```
